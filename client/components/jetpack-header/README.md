# JetpackHeader

The `JetpackHeader` component is intended to be used for co-branding of Jetpack flows. This may include things like Jetpack site connection or Jetpack-specific log in.

In cases where a partner has referred a new site, we'd want to co-brand the flow.

# Props

## partnerSlug (string) optional

An optional slug for the hosting partner. This will cause a partner-specific logo to be rendered.
