I've just finished publishing the weekly dev standup notes (https://jetpackinfinity.wordpress.com/2021/11/08/weekly-platform-dev-meeting-notes-week-44-2/), and I'd like to highlight that this is the nth week where we didn't manage to get to the latter parts of the agenda on this call.

There could be a couple ways to fix this problem. We could aim to make better use of our time together and be cognizant of our agenda during this call - or - we could try to schedule a bit more time together. What I'd like to propose is that we split this call in two.

The first call could happen on Monday at the current time, and would follow the existing pattern, but we actively trim the agenda as follows:
	- Team health check
	- Updates from Patrick
	- Non-project-related team discussions
	- Technical discussion as needed
	- Janitorial handoff as needed

The second call would be held on Tuesdays, and would be focused on roadmapping and project discussions. This call would be optional for non +jetpackavalon folks, and would include the following
	- Jetpack and/or Infinity roadmap review
	- Project discussion and updates for each open Avalon project
